JSColorMesh is a simple package that contains the needed functions to plot a grid of values on a 2 dimensional HTML5 canvas element. It is fast, thanks to the power of JavaScript.

It is completely written in JS, and can be used fairly trivially, simply by specifying the location of the canvas element.

REQUIRES Jquery!!
